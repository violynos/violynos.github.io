        <td>Five Nights at Freddy's Plot Summary

Fredbear's Family Diner opens, with two animatronics, Freddy and Bonnie. The two animatronics have spring-loaded endoskeletons, allowing them to be worn. An employee death at a second Fredbear location results in the retirement of the old suits, which turn gold over the decades of disuse. These suits are eventually hidden behind a wall in a closed-off safe room. The restaurant purchases two other suits, a purple Freddy and an all-black Bonnie, to use until the new animatronics arrive. They use this opportunity to rebrand themselves, adding Chica, Foxy, and the Puppet alongside a new Freddy and Bonnie. After many years as a successful establishment, a child is killed outside the restaurant by an unknown perpetrator. Freddy is the only witness. This event brings the restaurant under investigation, leading to its eventual closure. The ghost of the murdered child stays behind, inhabiting the Puppet.

Freddy Fazbear's Pizza opens a decade or so later, bringing back the forgotten brand. The old animatronics are recovered, but they are in an intense state of disrepair. A new line, the Toy line, is produced, using parts from the old animatronics and adding the lovable Balloon Boy. This transfers Freddy's knowledge of the Cake Murder into the Toy models. The Toy line has built-in criminal facial recognition, but Freddy's information confused them; they mistake all security guards for the murderer.

During the events of FNaF 2, the murderer returns as a security guard, having recently transferred to the day shift. He begins his killing spree, with each victim being placed in the old animatronics by the Puppet. The five victims inhabit Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and Golden Freddy. The Toy line believe the new night guard to be the murderer and attack him alongside the victims. At the end of the night guard's first week, the murderer is captured. The night guard becomes the day guard and is attacked by an unknown animatronic. This event, known as the Bite of '87, leads to the destruction of the Toy line and the closure of the restaurant.

Twenty or so years later, in FNaF1, the restaurant reopens at a new location using refurbished old animatronics. The restaurant does poorly and is set to close within the year. The day guard, who communicates with the night guard through phone messages, is killed horribly on a Thursday.

Years later, the murderer leaves prison and returns to the restaurant to destroy any remaining evidence of the murders. He lures the animatronics to the corner of the restaurant using the Purple Freddy suit from the old days and then smashes them when they cannot enter the back room. This only releases the ghosts from their prisons, allowing them to manifest themselves visibly and terrify the murderer into entering the abandoned Spring-loaded Bonnie costume. He sets off the springs and dies; his soul becomes trapped, becoming Springtrap.

With their murderer finally dead and revenge achieved, the children have completed their mission. The first victim, the one that inhabited the Puppet, gathered the other five in the back room for a birthday party in their respective animatronics, giving cake to others in reference to its inability to eat cake so many decades ago. The six children accept their fate and their completed mission and ascend to the afterlife. The final shot of the Good Ending is of the uninhabited heads after the children pass on.

Three decades later, a new organization decides to turn an abandoned building into a haunted house based on the old terrifying incidents. In the wreckage, Springtrap is discovered and set up as the sole animatronic of the haunted house. A night guard is hired. This guard remembered the horror of their youth and the terrifying animatronics' faces, possibly witnessing a murder or two as a child, leading to severe PTSD and hypoxic hallucinations. After a week on the job, through the ineptitude of the night guard, Fazbear's Fright is burned to the ground, destroying Springtrap and the various remnants of other animatronics. A few relics survive and are sold to a pawn shop, but none are known to still exist.

Except a lone hat.

Golden Freddy

Golden Freddy is the first animatronic, from the old days of Fredbear's Family Diner. He was discontinued and his endoskeleton removed after killing an employee at a sister location of the first restaurant. One of the five missing children was placed in here. The suit could not move, so the ghost could only attack through spectral projection.

Golden Bonnie/Spring Bonnie/Springtrap

Golden Bonnie, along with Golden Freddy, starred in the original restaurant and was discontinued after the spring-loaded endoskeleton of Freddy killed someone. Golden Bonnie was sealed away in the hidden safe room. Decades later, after the wall has naturally collapsed from decay, the murderer (aka Purple Guy) hides in the Golden Bonnie suit when chased by ghosts. The springs are set off, killing Purple Guy, sealing his soul and creating Springtrap. Springtrap is discovered and made the sole animatronic of Fazbear's Fright in FNaF 3, but is destroyed in the end by a fire.

Purple Freddy

Following the discontinuation of the spring-loaded suits, two new suits are purchased so that the restaurant can make do until the animatronics arrive. Purple Freddy is one of them. The Purple Guy uses this suit to lure the animatronics to their destruction sometime between FNaF 1 and FNaF 3.

Shadow Bonnie

Following the discontinuation of the spring-loaded suits, two new suits are purchased so that the restaurant can make do until the animatronics arrive. Shadow Bonnie is one of them. The poorly-ventilated FNaF2 restaurant sometimes results in the night guard hallucinating visions of this suit.

Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy

The four main animatronics of the series are purchased to replace Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie. They each contain a murdered child, placed there by the Puppet. The children died during FNaF 2, when a security guard went on a killing spree. They are destroyed by the murderer years later. The children ascend following a party after Purple Guy's death.

Puppet

The Puppet was purchased alongside the four main animatronics and houses the spirit of the child murdered during the days of Fredbear's Family Diner. It later puts the bodies of the children murdered by Purple Guy into Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy. The child ascends following a party after Purple Guy's death.

Toy Freddy, Toy Chica, Toy Bonnie, Toy Foxy/Mangle

The four Toy animatronics were purchased to replace the old animatronics. They were built with parts from the old models, giving them memory of the murder at Fredbear's Family Diner. They were connected to a facial recognition system, but it was faulty and mistook all security guards for Purple Guy, leading them to attack the innocent night guard. They were dismantled following the Bite of '87.

Balloon Boy

Balloon Boy was built alongside the Toy Animatronics and was destroyed with them.

FNaF 3 Phantoms

These hallucinations seen in the third game are brought on by a combination of hypoxia and PTSD in the night guard, possibly stemming from something they witnessed as a child at an old Freddy's restaurant.

Avenues for Future Games

The way I see it, a fourth game could come from the second location where GF suit killed someone, exploring a ghost haunting that location, or some creepy silliness from the hat. Other than that, I think the series is completely wrapped up. :(</td>
